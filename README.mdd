🌊 Wavein AI Verifier — AI Meets Blockchain on Sui

Wavein AI Verifier is a lightweight verification system that combines AI analysis with Sui blockchain transparency.
This repository currently deploys the React frontend on Vercel, while the AI backend (Node.js) and on-chain logic are still running locally for the hackathon demo.

All functionalities — including AI processing, verification hashing, and blockchain flow — are demonstrated through the project’s video demo, as required by the competition.
