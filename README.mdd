🚀 Wavein AI Verifier
AI-Powered Text Authenticity Detection with On-Chain Transparency

Wavein AI Verifier is a hybrid AI system designed to determine whether a piece of text is written by a human or by an AI model.
It combines:

Groq Llama 3.1 semantic analysis

Local linguistic & readability scoring

Hybrid confidence fusion

On-chain verification using Sui blockchain

Built for the Walrus Haulout Hackathon 2025 (AI × Data Track).

🎯 Purpose of the Project

As AI models become more advanced, distinguishing AI-generated content from human writing is increasingly difficult. This issue impacts:

Academic integrity

Journalism & misinformation detection

Content authenticity

Digital forensics

Compliance & regulation of AI-generated media

Wavein AI Verifier solves this by combining AI inference and linguistic analysis, then storing verified analysis immutably on blockchain.

🌟 Key Features
🤖 AI Semantic Analysis (Groq)

The system uses Llama 3.1 8B Instant via Groq for deep semantic evaluation.
It detects:

Patterned sentence structure

High coherence & uniformity typical of AI

Grammar consistency

Contextual fingerprints of LLM-generated text

It responds with structured JSON:

{"label": "AI", "confidence": 92, "reason": "Highly consistent patterns"}

🧠 Linguistic Complexity Analysis

Wavein also performs local analysis on the text, including:

Readability (Flesch-Kincaid)

Lexical density

Sentence complexity

Word variation

These metrics help reduce false positives and increase reliability.

⚖️ Hybrid Confidence Score

To improve accuracy, Wavein merges both sources:

finalScore = (0.7 × AI Confidence) + (0.3 × Local Complexity Score)


This produces a more balanced and trustworthy result.

🔗 On-Chain Storage (Sui Blockchain)

Wavein allows users to store their verification results on the Sui blockchain.

Why?

Immutability — stored results cannot be altered

Transparency — anyone can verify the data

Auditability — authentic history of AI analysis

Trust — prevents tampering in academic, legal, or enterprise contexts

Stored on-chain:

Original text (encoded)

AI judgement

Confidence score

🖥️ How to Run Locally
1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Flappybi/wavein_ai_verifire.git
cd wavein_ai_verifire

2. Install dependencies
npm install

3. Add your environment variables

Create .env:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

4. Run the frontend
npm run dev

5. Run Vercel serverless functions locally
vercel dev


This launches:

React frontend

/api/analyze serverless function

📡 API Specification
POST /api/analyze

Request:

{
  "text": "your text here..."
}


Response:

{
  "label": "HUMAN",
  "confidence": 74,
  "reason": "Natural variation | readability=5.3, lexicalDensity=0.49"
}
